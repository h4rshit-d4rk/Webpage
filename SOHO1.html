            office/home office (or single office/home office; sometimes short SOHO) refers to the category of
            business
            or cottage industry that involves from 1 to 10 workers. In New Zealand, the Ministry of Business, Innovation
            and
            Employment (MBIE) defines a small office as 6–19 employees and a micro office as 1–5.</var></p>
